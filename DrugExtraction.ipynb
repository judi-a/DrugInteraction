It is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots, because of its anti-platelet effect. Doctors often prescribe low-dose aspirin daily for patients who have had a heart attack or other heart issues to prevent further problems. Always take aspirin with food or milk to reduce possible gastrointestinal side effects such as gut bleeds. Do not use aspirin in children or teenagers with chickenpox or influenza symptoms because of the risk of Reye's syndrome.\n",

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which also can help reduce inflammation and pain. It works by blocking the production of certain natural substances in your body that cause inflammation. Ibuprofen is often used for relieving pain from various conditions such as headache, dental pain, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, or arthritis. It is also used to reduce fever and relieve minor aches and pain due to the common cold or flu. Always take ibuprofen with food to decrease your risk of stomach upset.\n",
